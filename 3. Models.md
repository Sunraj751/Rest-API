# Models
## Overview
-  What is a Model? 
   -  It is basically like creating a database, but instead of using SQL we will use C# code to create a database
   - A great way to visualize this is in a form of SQL table.

## Start here by setting up Hotel Bopoking Model
```C#
using System;
namespace BookingAPI.Models
{
    public class HotelBooking
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public int RoomNumber { get; set; }
        public string? ClientName { get; set; } 
    }
}
```
