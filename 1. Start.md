# API?
- Set of functions that developers use to access different functionalities from a third-party software
  - Example => we use system APIs for manipulating files or getting date and time

# Web API?
-  They are special APIs that uses `HTTP protocol`
-  Surfing a website:
   -  We basically make an HTTP request to the server and the server sends HTML content
-  But with `Web API`:
   -  We request a resource on the server, and instead of getting HTML from server, we get data in JSON or XML

# Types of Web API
- There are many types of API:
  - `REST API`: It let's us convert any data to a resource that can be Read, Updated, created or deleted by using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
    - A resource is something that can be read or identified on the web
  - `RPC`: In this client sends a method name and arguments to a server, which returns JSON or XML data. `REST` is about resouces, `RPC` is about actions
  - `GraphQL`: This is a form of API with a single Endpoint. Clients indicate in the body of it's request if they want to perform a query or a mutation using HTTP methods `GET` or `POST`.

# Flow of REST API
## Client
- The client makes a `request`
- That `request` is made to an endpoint which is a `URL`
- Request uses one of the `HTTP Methods`, to let the server know which actions to take.
  - `GET`: Used to request data
  - `POST`: Used to send data
  - `PUT and PATCH`: Used to update the data
  - `DELETE`: used to delete the data
- `HTTP Request` can have additional information for the server in the headers

## Server
- The server returns a response with data regarding a `resource`.
- This `response` holds information for the client in form of Status codes, Headers, or Body(data)
- The data can be in XML or JSON format

# Why to use API?
- For providing some `service` (like integrate payments in the application)
  - Example:
    - `User` buys stuff on phone
    - On the Backend, application submits the payment to stripe, and stripe returns back a conformation that the payment is done  
- For `backend` (like creating a backend for mobile app)
- For `exchanging data` between 2 different systems
